# Data

**No dataset files are committed to this repository.** NTU RGB+D's release
agreement forbids redistribution, and the other sources are large. Download
each dataset below into this directory — everything under `data/` except this
file is gitignored.

## Expected layout

## 1. Bullying10K — DVS event camera, physical bullying

- Home: https://www.brain-cog.network/dataset/Bullying10k/
- Code/docs: https://github.com/Brain-Cog-Lab/Bullying10k
- ~10,000 segments, ~255 GB total of `.npy` event files (timestamp, x, y, polarity),
  recorded with a DVS346 sensor (346 x 260). You can download per-action subsets
  rather than the whole corpus.
- Actions: slapping, punching, kicking, strangling, hair grabbing, pushing,
  plus non-violent controls (walking, greeting, handshake, finger-guessing).
- Also ships COCO-format pose labels — usable directly in the unified skeleton
  pipeline as an alternative to extracting poses from pseudo-frames.
- License: CC BY 4.0 — citable and referenceable, but still not committed here.

## 2. NTU RGB+D 120 — 3D skeletons only

- Request access (signed release agreement required):
  https://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/dataset/actionRecognition/
- Download **only the 3D skeleton modality**:
  - "NTU RGB+D" skeletons (~5.8 GB)
  - "NTU RGB+D 120" additional skeletons (~4.5 GB)
- Do **not** download RGB / depth / IR — hundreds of GB and unused here.
- Unzip all `.skeleton` files into `data/ntu/skeletons/`.
- Grab the missing-skeleton lists from https://github.com/shahroudy/NTURGB-D
  (some samples have corrupt or absent tracking and should be skipped).
- This repo only converts the mutual-action subset relevant to aggression
  detection — see the class lists in `src/preprocessing/ntu_skeleton.py`.
- **This data cannot be redistributed in any form.**

## 3. UT-Interaction — surveillance-style RGB confrontations

- Home: https://cvrc.ece.utexas.edu/SDHA2010/Human_Interaction.html
  (Ryoo & Aggarwal, SDHA 2010 challenge; mirrors exist if the site is down)
- 120 segmented videos across 6 classes: shake-hands, point, hug, push, kick, punch.
- Two sets: parking lot (Set 1) and lawn (Set 2), fixed outdoor cameras —
  the closest match to real CCTV framing of the three core datasets.

## 4. UBI-Fights — real-world surveillance fights, frame-level labels

- Home: https://socia-lab.di.ubi.pt/EventDetection/ (direct `UBI_FIGHTS.zip`, ~7.6 GB)
- 1,000 real-world videos (216 fight / 784 normal), 640x360 @30fps, ~80 hours,
  annotated 0/1 **per frame** — usable for both the binary aggressive pool and
  temporal-localization evaluation.
- Unzip into `data/ubi_fights/UBI_FIGHTS/`, then convert:
  `python -m src.preprocessing.ubi_fights --root data/ubi_fights/UBI_FIGHTS --output outputs/ubi_poses --device 0`
- Its main value here: hundreds of hours of *normal CCTV motion* as hard
  negatives — the domain our lab-captured datasets lack entirely.

## 5. Fight-Detection Surveillance (seymanurakti) — real CCTV fight clips

- Repo: https://github.com/seymanurakti/fight-detection-surv-dataset (MIT; videos are in the repo)
- 300 clips (150 `fight/` + 150 `noFight/`), ~2s each, real surveillance framing.
- Download + convert:
  `git clone https://github.com/seymanurakti/fight-detection-surv-dataset.git data/fight_surv`
  `python -m src.preprocessing.labeled_folder --root data/fight_surv --output outputs/fightsurv_poses --device 0`

## 6. NTU CCTV-Fights — best real-CCTV fight dataset (request access)

- Home: https://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/dataset/cctvFights/ — 1,000 videos (17.7h, 2,414
  fight instances), real CCTV + mobile, **frame-level** start/end fight annotations.
- Same NTU ROSE signed-release process as NTU RGB+D (use your existing ROSE account):
  register → request page → accept agreement → await approval → download (~7.2 GB).
- Once downloaded, share the annotation format and a converter will be added
  (frame-level labels segment exactly like UBI-Fights).

## Also evaluated (not integrated)

- **Roboflow classroom-fight** — image-level (no motion); our temporal model needs
  64-frame sequences, so single frames don't fit. Would need your Roboflow API key.
- **Musawer14 fight_detection_yolov8** — an image-based violence *detector* (bounding
  boxes), a different paradigm from our skeleton model; could serve as an optional
  second-opinion signal, not a training source.
- **V-JEPA 2** (Meta) — a video world-model for robotics/prediction, not violence
  detection; integrating it would replace the skeleton pipeline entirely.

## 7. RWF-2000 — real-world CCTV violence (optional)

- https://github.com/mchengny/RWF2000-Video-Database-for-Violence-Detection
- 2,000 five-second clips (violent / non-violent) sourced from real surveillance
  footage — the only genuinely messy real-world data in the stack.
- Access requires submitting the request form linked in that repo.
