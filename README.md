# School-Safe Vision 🎥🛡️

[![CI](https://github.com/clyv/bullying-detection/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/clyv/bullying-detection/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A computer vision research project exploring whether bullying, harassment,
and physical aggression can be detected from school surveillance cameras
using visual signals alone — no audio, no identity recognition.

## Local real-time monitor

The repository also includes an optional local review dashboard with an
RWF-2000-fine-tuned temporal X3D fight classifier, YOLO pose/tracking and crowd
detection, offline Russian Whisper speech recognition, RuBERT toxicity analysis,
adaptive loud-voice detection, multimodal confirmation, video/audio evidence, and
SQLite plus JSONL event logs. A single hand movement is not an alert. These
signals flag clips for human review; they do not identify people or autonomously
determine that bullying occurred. See [the Russian runtime guide](docs/RUNTIME_MONITOR_RU.md).

```powershell
.\scripts\setup_monitor.ps1
.\scripts\start_monitor.ps1
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Runtime settings are documented in
`.env.runtime.example`; set them as environment variables before starting.
The first audio-enabled launch downloads the selected Whisper model. Logs and
snapshots are written under `runtime_data/`. Confirmed camera incidents retain a
short MP4 clip; profanity, threats, toxic speech, and loud-voice signals retain a
six-second WAV window. The dashboard can play both without leaving the event log.

## The Approach

Rather than relying on raw video appearance, this project unifies three
very different datasets into a single **2D pose-skeleton representation**,
allowing a model to learn aggressive interaction dynamics that transfer
across camera types and environments:

| Dataset | Modality | Contributes |
|---|---|---|
| Bullying10K | DVS event camera | Physical bullying actions, privacy-preserving |
| NTU RGB+D 120 | Kinect skeletons | Aggressive vs. neutral two-person interactions (point, push, follow, grab, whisper) |
| UT-Interaction | RGB video | Outdoor surveillance-style confrontations |

```
Bullying10K (DVS events)  → accumulate to pseudo-frames → pose extraction ─┐
NTU RGB+D 120 (3D skel)   → project 3D → 2D ───────────────────────────────┤
UT-Interaction (RGB)      → pose extraction (YOLO-Pose) ───────────────────┼→ unified 2D skeleton sequences
                                                                           │
School CCTV (deployment)  → pose extraction (same extractor) ──────────────┘
                                        ↓
                    Skeleton-based classifier (ST-GCN / 2s-AGCN)
                                        ↓
              Classes: aggressive / bullying / neutral interactions
```

RWF-2000 (real CCTV violence clips) is kept in the stack as an optional
fourth source — the only genuinely messy real-world footage.

## What This Is (and Isn't)

✅ A feasibility study for pose-based aggression detection on CCTV

✅ Privacy-conscious by design — skeletons, not faces

❌ Not a production system — no claims of detecting verbal-only abuse
   or social exclusion, which are invisible to cameras

## Getting Started

Requires **Python 3.12**.

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows  (source venv/bin/activate on Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **GPU note:** `requirements.txt` pins CUDA 12.8 (`cu128`) PyTorch builds,
> required for RTX 50-series (Blackwell / sm_120) GPUs. On CPU-only or
> older-GPU machines, install the matching plain builds instead.

Fetch datasets following [data/README.md](data/README.md), then run the
preprocessing for whichever sources you have:

```
# UT-Interaction (RGB) — YOLO-Pose
python -m src.preprocessing.pose_extraction   --input data/ut_interaction --output outputs/ut_poses
# NTU RGB+D 120 (3D skeletons) — projected to 2D
python -m src.preprocessing.ntu_skeleton      --input data/ntu/skeletons  --output outputs/ntu_poses --classes relevant
# Bullying10K (DVS) — Route B: convert the provided COCO pose labels directly
python -m src.preprocessing.bullying10k_poses --input data/bullying10k    --output outputs/b10k_poses
# Bullying10K — Route A: accumulate events to pseudo-frames, then extract poses
python -m src.preprocessing.dvs_to_frames     --input data/bullying10k    --output outputs/b10k_frames --png
python -m src.preprocessing.pose_extraction   --input outputs/b10k_frames --output outputs/b10k_poses
```

Every route converges on the same `.npz` format: `keypoints (T, M, 17, 2)`
COCO-order pixel coordinates plus `scores (T, M, 17)` confidences (dataset
converters also write an integer `label`).

Train and evaluate the ST-GCN baseline on a single dataset, configured through a
YAML file ([configs/baseline.yaml](configs/baseline.yaml) for UT-Interaction,
[configs/bullying10k.yaml](configs/bullying10k.yaml) for Bullying10K,
[configs/ntu.yaml](configs/ntu.yaml) for NTU):

```
python -m src.training.train      --config configs/bullying10k.yaml   # checkpoints to outputs/checkpoints/
python -m src.evaluation.evaluate --config configs/bullying10k.yaml   # accuracy + per-class confusion matrix
```

For the **unified model** ([configs/unified.yaml](configs/unified.yaml)), every
dataset's native classes are collapsed to a binary *aggressive vs. neutral* space
([src/datasets/taxonomy.py](src/datasets/taxonomy.py)). One command runs the
pooled aggressive-vs-neutral confusion analysis and the leave-one-dataset-out
cross-dataset / ablation study:

```
python -m src.evaluation.cross_dataset --config configs/unified.yaml
```

Finally, **temporal localization** answers *when* an incident occurs in a
continuous stream: it slides the trained binary model over an untrimmed pose
sequence and merges aggressive windows into incident intervals (frame ranges +
timestamps) to flag for human review.

```
python -m src.evaluation.localize --stream outputs/cctv_poses/clip.npz \
    --checkpoint outputs/checkpoints/stgcn_baseline_epoch_40.pt --config configs/unified.yaml
```

The preprocessing, metrics, and temporal-localization logic is unit-tested
(`pip install pytest ruff && pytest`); the model, training, single-/cross-dataset
evaluation, and stream-localization paths are covered too. The same checks run in
CI on every push.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1 — Baseline:** pose-extraction pipeline (YOLO-Pose) + ST-GCN baseline (training & evaluation) on UT-Interaction / RWF-2000
- [x] **Phase 2 — Bullying10K:** DVS events → pseudo-frames → poses, or the dataset's provided COCO pose labels → unified `.npz`
- [x] **Phase 3 — NTU mutual actions:** relevant-class subset, 3D → 2D projection, unified labels, added to the training set
- [x] **Phase 4 — Unified model:** binary aggressive-vs-neutral space, cross-dataset evaluation, per-dataset (leave-one-out) ablations, confusion analysis
- [x] **Phase 5 (stretch):** temporal localization — sliding-window scoring + incident-interval merging to flag *when* in a stream aggression occurs (school-proxy testing still pending suitable footage)

## Limitations

What this system fundamentally cannot see:

- **Verbal-only abuse** delivered with neutral body language — there is no audio, by design
- **Social exclusion / relational bullying** and **cyberbullying** — not visually observable
- **Domain gap:** every training dataset uses adult actors in non-school settings;
  children's body proportions and movement dynamics will degrade performance.
  This gap is documented, not solved.
- **Camera dependence:** pose extraction degrades with distance, angle, and
  resolution, so real-world quality hinges on camera placement

Any deployment of a system like this should only **flag incidents for human
review** — it must never make autonomous accusations.
